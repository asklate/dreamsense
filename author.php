<h2>Hello, my name is Kyle Eggleston</h2>

    I enjoy writing, reading, and a bunch of other things in life.</p>
<p>Most of it has to do with programming though. I enjoy programming in Java
    and other languages like ColdFusion. I'm currently learning Perl and Python.</p>
<p>Television wise, I enjoy anything Star Trek, and Quantum Leap. Night Court
    has also become a favorite of mine. Oh and we can't forget Ghosts on CBS. 
    Older shows have also taken a soft part of my heart as well. Viper, Seven Days, 
    Sliders and the like. Hogan's Heroes has also found its way into my heart. Such
    a light hearted comedy that is fun to watch.
</p>
<p>I wouldn't say I'm an avid gamer in any sense of the word, but I do enjoy playing
    Minecraft, The Stanley Parable, and Gone Home. Always looking for a new game
    to play.
