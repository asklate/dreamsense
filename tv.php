<p>TV is made up. Let's face it, it tells stories that can be inspired by true events, but a lot of the time
    it's just made up from some guy's mind. If the stories are good, the show does well and it grows a fan base.
    If the stories suck? Well then the show flops and it's taken off the air. Simple as mud right? Right!</p>
<p>It can really be a downer if you come across a show you really like, but it doesn't sit well 
    with audiences. The show gets cancelled and you can no longer watch new episodes of your favorite show.
    Hopefully your now cancelled show goes to DVD sales, so you can at least have what was once great so
    you can enjoy those episodes over and over again. Firefly is a great example of this. When it aired
    on TV, FOX showed the episodes out of order. People didn't understand the show and it didn't really
    do well. Later on, DVD sales went up and they got green lit for a movie.</p>
