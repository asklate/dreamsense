<p>There are times when you see things that aren't there. They don't exist.
    I know it sounds like something straight out of wonderland or some other
    book. But it's not. It's actually a real thing.

    For example, during one of my hospital stays, I watched a nun walk into my
    room. I followed her. Entering my room she saw me and said she was sorry and
    promptly left. I tried to follow her but she disappeared. I couldn't find where
    she went. I later found out that no nuns worked at the hospital, it wasn't that
    kind of facility. This has since changed, as the hospital has taken on a very religious
    kind of name.
</p>

<p>I wonder why I saw a nun. Was there a reason behind it all? I don't know. It could have
    easily just been a coincidence. Whatever my mind decides to come up with, well I don't
    have much control over that now do I? No, I didn't think so.

<p>Another visual hallucination I had was of a kid wearing a red sweater. It was like what
    you would see right out of Little Red Riding Hood. At least it felt like it. It was so
    odd, just so very odd. The kid was standing by the window. It was Christmas time. She
    ended up levitating an ornament from the window. At least that's what I saw. Who knows
    if it really happened or not.
</p>

<p>Then there was the little boy wearing jeans and a yellow shirt. I asked when uncle and aunt
    so and so had kids, and I was told they didn't have any. But I saw the boy. yeah he wasn't
    actually there for some reason. Just another hallucination.
