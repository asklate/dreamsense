<p>Life comes to an end. Everything comes to an end. There's nothing that doesn't stop.
    There's a beginning to life and there's an end to life. It's like the end of the line.
    The road can go no further.
</p>

<p>People mourn through death, it's just a way to get through it. The grieving process can
    be difficult and different for each person. I wish death wasn't a part of it all. But
    that's life and that's just how everything will go for everyone. You can't get out of this
    life except through death.
</p>

<p>Personally I can't wait to see what's on the other side. It would be an interesting thought
    if life just didn't end, don't get me wrong. I'm not sure exactly how that would happen, 
    but if it were possible, I think it would be an interesting thing to take place. An afterlife
    without dying so to speak.
</p>

<p>Without an end, this life would simply continue onward. There wouldn't be a final hurrah as
    it were. I don't know, I find there to be an appeal with a final end to it all.
