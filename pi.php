<h2>You have found &#960; Good Job!</h2>

<p>I realize this page wasn't too difficult to find. I could have thrown up words that said
    <span class="red">ACCESS DENIED</span> in nice big red letters. I've done that before 
    for fun. It's a throw back to the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/" 
        target="_blank" title="The NET">The NET</a>. If you haven't seen it? I highly 
    recommend that you check it out.
