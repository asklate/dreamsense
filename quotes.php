<p>"But I, being poor, have only my dreams; 
    I have spread my dreams under your feet; 
    Tread softly because you tread on my dreams." - 
    <span class="author">W.B. Yeats</span></p>

<p>"Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
    Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
    I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow;
    I don't wanna wait to do this one more time" - 
    <span class="author">Blink-182</span></p>

<p>"Don't be a dick!" - 
    <span class="author">Wil Wheaton</span></p>

<p>"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference." - 
    <span class="author">Robert Frost</span></p>

<p>"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the 
    age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of 
    belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Life, 
    it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the 
    winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before 
    us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the 
    other way-in short, the period was so far the like present period, that 
    some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for 
    good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only." - 
    <span class="author">Charles Dickens</span></p>

<p>"I guess you never heard, I've met our makers they don't even know your name." - 
    <span class="author">Sum 41</span></p>

<p>"Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, 
    but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. 
    If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.
    Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water 
    into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it 
    becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. 
    Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend." - 
    <span class="author">Bruce Lee</span></p>


<p>"I believe that when we leave a place, part of it goes with us and part 
    of us remains. Go anywhere in the station when it is quiet, and just 
    listen. After a while, you will hear the echoes of all our conversations, 
    every thought and word we've exchanged. Long after we are gone, our voices 
    will linger in these walls for as long as this place remains. But I will 
    admit that the part of me that is going will very much miss the part of 
    you that is staying." - 
    <span class="author">G'Kar, Babylon 5</span></p>

<p>"Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges.
    'In time of war, the law falls silent.' Cicero. So is that what we have become; 
    a 24th century Rome, driven by nothing other than the certainty that Caesar can do no wrong?!"
    - 
    <span class="author">Julian Bashir, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</span></p>

<p>"We are problems that want to be solved
    We are children that need to be loved
    We were willing, we came when you called
    But man, you fooled us, enough is enough" - 
    <span class="author">Pink</span></p>

<p>"My shoes are too tight, and I've forgotten how to dance." - 
    <span class="author">Londo Mollari, Babylon 5</span></p>

<p>"And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
    Or the moment of truth in your lies
    When everything feels like the movies
    And you bleed just to know you're alive" - 
    <span class="author">Goo Goo Dolls</span></p>

<p>"If you are searching for that one person who will change your life, take a look in the mirror."
