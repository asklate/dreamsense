<p>I didn't end up having cancer. It would have been in my bladder of all places. 
    Thank goodness it wasn't there. I've known some people in my time that have 
    had cancer. Talk about a scary ride for them. Fortunately I have not yet had to 
    face that monster. If I ever do, I hope I go quickly.</p>
