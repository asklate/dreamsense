<p>Ah religion, it can be a touchy subject when you come down to it. Not everyone views religion in
    the same light. There are some who are more religious than others, and some who are not religious
    at all. Everyone is entitled to their own thoughts of course.
</p>

<p>Having grown up Mormon or LDS, I was taught at a very young age what I was supposed to follow
    and not follow. Things to do or say. That kind of thing. I've since distanced myself from
    Mormonism and have set out on a path to call my own.
</p>

<p>I still have many <a href="questions.php" title="Questions">questions</a> regarding the LDS
    faith. Mostly things from it's own Church's History. I've yet to find an answer to these
    questions.
</p>

<p>In an attempt to figure out who I am, I've written my own <a href="creed.php" title="Creed">creed</a>.
    This is mostly just for me, the things I believe in currently. It might change at any given time
    depending on what I find to be true and follow that truth.
