<p>Ever hear voices? You're lucky if you don't.</p>

    A lot of the time I hear my name being called out. For a while I was hearing a little
    girl giggling or calling out for her mom.</p>

<p>It's not always tied to actual voices either, sometimes you hear movement. I've heard walking
    around, we have hardwood floors. I've heard typing on my computer. At first I thought it was
    ghosts, but now I have a feeling it was me hearing things. When the little girl was typing on
    my computer and giggling, it would freak me out. Then she would call out for mommy. I haven't
    heard her in a while, I expect to hear her again. I don't want to hear voices mind you, that
    would suck. I don't enjoy hearing voices of any kind.</p>

<p>Sometimes the voices argue with each other. I don't like that. They have so many things to say
    and argue about who gets to talk next. They want to keep it up, it's annoying. I wish I had a way
    to make them stop. It would be nice, I won't lie. I'm already on medications, but I'm not sure if
    any of them make the voices stop. I still hear things here and there so yeah, just not sure.</p>

<p>It would be nice if there were just a medication I could take to make everything just stop. I'm not
    talking about life itself stopping, but the voices and hallucinations stopping. I need them to stop
    one of these days. If I think about them, they seem to appear more often. If I ignore them, they don't.
    Am I just making it all up in my mind? I don't know. I doubt it.</p>

<p>Currently there are two male voices and one female voice that occupy my time. The males tend to argue
    about anything and everything. One tends to try and egg me on, the other sometimes goes along with it
    other times he keeps quiet. The female just tells me to kill myself. She doesn't really have any other
    goal than that. She wants me dead. It's that simple.</p>
