<p>2003 showed the beginning of this website. Looking at the whois lookup for this site,
    it shows that the site was registered on 2003-08-23. It's been running in some form or
    fashion ever since.

<p>This website has gone through many iterations over the past years. As of this writing it's
    been up for 20 years about. Maybe a little over 20, but not much. I've mostly used the website
    for the e-mail address.
