<h2>2015 Doctrine Regarding Children's Baptism</h2>

<p>Jesus taught the people to not offend His little ones, and encouraged them all to come unto Him.
</p>

<p>There are those who would practice unrighteous dominion towards the children of the church, and this 
is wrong. The children of the church must be protected against predators within the church. It is sad 
that such a thought even needs to be brought to people's attention, yet it is real.
</p>

<p>Said of children:</p>

<blockquote>
"In some minds there seems to be an idea that there should be a different form of blessing for children 
born of non-members and for those who are identified with the Church; and it is from such sources that 
in the case of children belonging to members of the Church 'the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob' 
and all the attendant favors are frequently conferred upon the child. This is all wrong. If we take the 
example of our Lord and Redeemer, who is our pattern and whose example we cannot too closely follow, we 
find that He blessed all who were brought to Him. We have no hint that He asked whose children they were,
 or the standing or faith of their parents. His remark was, 'Suffer little children, and forbid them not, 
 to come unto me, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven;' and He laid His hands upon them and blessed them. 
 All little children, no matter what their parentage may be, are innocent in the sight of heaven, and they 
 should be received as such and blessed as such." -George Q Cannon, Latter-day Saints'.

<p>There is also a policy put out by the church in their Handbook 1 for Stake Presidents, Bishops, 
    Mission Presidents etc. that will not allow a child who has same sex parents be baptized into the 
    church of Christ. They cannot receive a name and a blessing either. Since they cannot be baptized, 
    receive a name and a blessing, they cannot go on a mission, or enter the temple to be sealed for 
    time and all eternity. This was later clarified as being revelation by Russel M. Nelson in a worldwide 
    devotional he gave. Becoming True Millennials, January 10, 2016, LDS.org

<p>Said of the policy change:</p>

<blockquote>
The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles counsel together and share all the Lord 
has directed us to understand and to feel individually and collectively. And then we watch the 
Lord move upon the President of the Church to proclaim the Lord's will.

This prophetic process was followed in 2012 with the change in minimum age for missionaries 
and again with the recent additions to the Church’s handbook, consequent to the legalization of 
same-sex marriage in some countries. Filled with compassion for all, and especially for the 
children, we wrestled at length to understand the Lord's will in this matter. Ever mindful of 
God’s plan of salvation and of His hope for eternal life for each of His children, we considered 
countless permutations and combinations of possible scenarios that could arise. We met repeatedly 
in the temple in fasting and prayer and sought further direction and inspiration. And then, when 
the Lord inspired His prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, to declare the mind of the Lord and 
the will of the Lord, each of us during that sacred moment felt a spiritual confirmation. It was 
our privilege as Apostles to sustain what had been revealed to President Monson. Revelation from 
the Lord to His servants is a sacred process, and so is your privilege of receiving personal revelation.

<p>When the child turns eighteen years old, and moves out of their parents house, then they can be 
    baptized. In effect, they must turn away from their parents and disown them.
</p>

<p>This appears to go against the second Article of Faith.</p>

<p>It should be noted, as of April 4, 2019, the November 2015 policy has been reversed. It was 
    stated as revelation to bring it into the handbook, and now it has been declared as revelation 
    to be changed. Is God changing His mind regarding what he wants for His children?</p>

<p>To me a change indicates an inconsistency in teachings.</p>
