<p>I first registered the dreamsense.com domain name back in 2003. I sold it in 2024. Roughly 20 years later.
    I'm kinda sorry that I did. But the money was needed so I sold it. DreamSense had gone through a lot of
    changes over the years. Sometimes it was just a placeholder for my e-mail address. Other times it was
    a place where I would showcase my writings and programming. I never really felt like it had a home on
    the internet. Nothing worth of substance as it were.
</p>

<p>Now I have a new domain name, askearly.net. I'm not really sure what this is. Possibly just a place where
    I will put all of my writings as before. Nothing special really. Just my small corner of the internet.
