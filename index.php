<h2>Welcome to AskEarly.net (formerly DreamSense.com)!</h2>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what's going to go here. I mean it could be a lot of things,
    but I just don't have a clue at the moment. My old <a href="blog.php">blog</a>, if you can call it that,
    went the ways of the dinosaur. Yes it blew up with a stroke of the delete key. I didn't
    mean for it to happen. It just kinda did, and now we're left with whatever this thing is.</p>

<p>There are thoughts here that talk about <a href="mental-illness.php">Mental Illness</a>. They're 
    what I experience on a day to day basis. You never know what will happen in your life, that much is 
    certain. But if things do go south, know that you are not alone. There are people who care about you. 
    This is covered more in the "<a href="life.php">life</a>" section of this website.</p>

<p>I'm putting stories I've written on this website. That's the main purpose of it, is to
    showcase my writings.</p>

<p>My new <a href="https://dreamsense447.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a> will contain programming 
    code, as well as off the cuff thoughts that don't belong on this website.</p>
