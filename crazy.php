<p>Being called crazy by other people hurts. How dare they label me. I can call myself crazy, that's
    one thing. But when someone else calls me crazy? How dare they have the nerve to even utter such
    words. They don't have the right to determine if I am crazy or not. They don't have the right to
    say that about me. Yet they do. Oh they try and say, forgive me if I'm being rude but...yeah you
    should have stopped before you said but. You're being rude ok? That's all there is to it. I mean
    how would they feel if I called <em>them</em> crazy? I highly doubt they would enjoy that. I don't
    call them crazy by the way, that would be down right rude. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> 
    says the following about "crazy".
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity">
"Crazy" is a word that is often used to describe abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. In 
    psychiatry, "crazy" may refer to psychosis, which is the presence of delusions, hallucinations, 
    and disorganization of thought and speech. However, "crazy" is not an official term in psychiatry. 
    Mental illness is an illness, and the use of the word "crazy" to describe those who suffer from 
    mental illness is harmful and perpetuates negative stereotypes.

<p>See? it's rude to call someone crazy. Why people would do that in the first place is beyond me.
    I don't understand it. I don't get it. It simply makes no sense to me and here I sit wondering
    why people do that to begin with. Maybe they have an insecurity that causes them to call other
    people names? I don't know, I don't have a clue how their mind works. Nor do I claim to know
    how their mind works. That would be wrong on so many levels.
