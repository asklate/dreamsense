<h2>Making Sense of the Dream</h2>
            
<p>Welcome. there are many things in this life that I would like to try and
figure out. It's not always an easy journey though. Sometimes we come and
go as we please, yet we really do not have the answers we are searching
for.</p>
    
<p>Lots of people have dreams. Ambition. Aspirations they wish to accomplish
before they kick the bucket or leave this world as it were. I suppose that's
why they call it a bucket list. You kick the bucket and bam you're gone.</p>
        
<p>The dream belongs in the past. There is no current dream to belong to.</p>
        
<blockquote>
Had I a dream, I would share it with<br/>
everyone out there in the world<br/>
if but a dream existed<br/>
and there was a world to share.
</blockquote>
        
<p>The dream begins as it always does. I'm swimming in a pool. A man enters and
points a gun at me. Before I can reach for my own weapon, he fires two rounds
into my chest killing me. I wake up in a startled mess. My sheets are soaked
from sweat. I live another day only to have the dream again another night.</p>
        
<p>After waking up, I have no recollection of why the bad guy was
after me. It makes no sense. I have no clues except for what's in the dream
itself.</p>
        
<p>What if we are on this earth at the expense of ourselves. People are watching
us and making jokes, exchanging money on how our day will turn out. We are not
alone in this life. People are watching. They watch our every movement to see
if we will do as they expect us to do.</p>
        
<p>You could consider it a gamble. A game these people are playing, but they
    aren't playing with chips to be won at a casino. No, they are playing with
    people's lives.</p>
        
<p>In my dream I get tossed into the river. If I'm lucky the dream doesn't do
    a reset and I wake up. However there are times when I wake up wihin the dream.
    The events play out again esactly as they did the first, and I wake up a second
    time within the dream. You could say it's Inception. When I finally wake up, I
    have to question if this is real life or if I am still in the dream.</p>
        
<p>If I could simply forget the dream and never have it resurface that
    would be ideal. But the dream never goes away. I can't even begin to tell
    you how long I've had this dream night after night for a few days. It goes
    away for a little while, but then it comes back. Always the same story.
    Always the same outcome.</p>
        
<blockquote>
    To touch that which is real<br/>
    only to find out it's false,<br/>
    the dream will catch you<br/>
    and take you in.
</blockquote>
        
<p>I often wonder if I shouldn't dwell on the dream. If the dream will
    just be there. If it's always going to be there, why should I dwell
    on whatever it is? Doesn't quite make sense I know, but maybe it will
    eventually.</p>
        
<p>The dream never makes any sense. I can dream it over and over again
    and it will never make sense to me. It's something I've come use to.
    Something I will simply have to live with and accept as time goes on.</p>
        
<p>What if the dream isn't real? What if it's just something that makes
    me think it's real? There are so many possibilities out there regarding
    the different dreams I have. I doubt I'll ever get through them all.</p>
        
<blockquote>
    Touch the sky and see where it takes you. Dream the impossible and see
    what happens.
</blockquote>
        
<p>Dreams are different for everyone. Sometimes a dream can mean nothing
    at all. Other times a dream can mean something very real and have a deeper
    meaning than face value.</p>
        
<p>Life has a purpose and a plan to go along with it. Your dreams can be
    part of that plan and purpose. It doesn't have to be limited to the
    thoughts of other people. You have full reign to do as you please.</p>
    

<h2>The Dreamer</h2>

You are the dreamer. There is nothing wrong with dreaming. You have
aspirations you wish to fulfill in life. Some are grand while others
are manageable. Either way life will come as it will and you will have
the opportunity to make your dreams become known.</p>

<p>Yes just like that episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, "Far Beyond The Stars."</p>

<h2>The Dream</h2>

    You are but the dream as well. In that episode, there's a quote in it, that
    the main character is the dreamer and the dream. That's what life feels
    like at this moment. Alwys here yet not here at all. Present yet not present.
    Does that make sense? No, I didn't think so either. But that's what this life is all about.
    We have to be able to look out for that which is important in life.
</p>

<h2>A Final Thought</h2>

<p>Dreams, here we are with the dreams. Dreams come and go long before we
  are able to understand and comprehend them. They are sometimes the inner
  most desires of our heart. There are many different kinds of dreams mind you.
  Some dreams are good, others can be nightmares. I don't like nightmares, I don't
  think there's anyone who enjoys them. I could be mistaken of course.
</p>

<p>A dream can mean many things to different people. It doesn't always have to 
mean the same thing to you or them or anyone else. YOU are your own dreamer. 
Make sure that you determine what your dreams mean.</p>

<p>I find it difficult sometimes to dream because I forget what I was dreaming.
  sure it's fresh in my mind when I wake up, but then it fades. That's what's
  frustrating to me the most. I hate it. But what can you do about it? Not much
  I'm afraid, not much at all.
</p>

<p>I wonder what the official definition of dreams is, let's find out, Google says
  the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
a series of thoughts, images, and sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep
</blockquote>

<p>I don't usually remember my dreams. I don't know if I'm just not getting enough REM Sleep
  or what, but typically I just don't remember much. I've thought about making a dream journal
  that I would write in when I wake from a dream. But I'd have to remember to write in it and
  not just turn over and go back to sleep.
</p>

<p>When I take a certain medication I can recall my dream for a little bit after waking up. So
    I guess I <em>can</em> remember my dreams, just not for very long. Like last night I dreamed
    about something, I can't remember what it is right now at the moment. But I know I dreamed.
    Something to do with an old bookstore. That's all I can remember.
