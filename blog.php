<h2>My Old Blog</h2>
<p>So this site used to be a blog. It used to contain programming content. I've decided to move it
    to YouTube exclusively. There's no point in having a blog anymore.

<p>It was good to have a blog while it lasted. I might bring it back someday I don't know. We'll 
    just have to wait and see what happens.</p>

<p>You can view my new blog <a href="https://dreamsense447.blogspot.com" target="_blank" title="Blog">here</a>.</p>
