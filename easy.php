<p>I am waiting to hear back on some scary things as 
of late. It's the big "C" word. Yeah, I'm waiting to hear back to see if I need 
to get tested for <a class="red" href="cancer.php">cancer</a>. When you hear the word 
<a class="red" href="cancer.php">cancer</a> you aren't certain what to think at first. 
I mean, you freak out for a second or two, but you don't know what to say. 
You think, oh this isn't happening to me. It can't happen to me! Well, 
let me tell you. It can happen to anyone.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just want to give up on life, keeping a <a href="diary.php">diary</a> can help. 
<a class="red" href="suicide.php">Suicide</a> isn't <del>always</del> an option. 
It might feel like an option at times, but it really isn't. If you ever feel 
like you want to take your life, please <strong>see someone and get help</strong>.</p>

<p>Later on in life, I was diagnosed with <a class="red" href="schizoaffective-disorder.php">Schizoaffective Disorder</a>. 
  Don't know what that is? Well let's look it up for you (From the 
  <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoaffective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354504#Overview" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic</a>):
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoaffective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354504#Overview">
<p>Schizoaffective disorder is a mental health disorder that is marked by a combination of 
  schizophrenia symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, and mood disorder symptoms, 
  such as depression or mania.</p>

<p>The two types of schizoaffective disorder — both of which include some symptoms of schizophrenia — 
  are:</p>

<p>Bipolar type, which includes episodes of mania and sometimes major depression</p>
<p>Depressive type, which includes only major depressive episodes</p>

<p>How fun is that? Actually it's not fun at all. Allow me to give three examples of what I face
  in my day to day living:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Having to constantly battle your demons isn't a fun thing at all to overcome.</li>
  <li>Constantly trying to figure out what's real and what's fake in the world, isn't fun at all.</li>
  <li>Constantly second guessing myself if I heard something isn't fun in the slightest.</li>
</ol>

<p>So that's how I live my life. Constantly trying to figure things out. I mean
  isn't everyone trying to figure things out? That's not what I mean of course. For me, trying to
  figure things out takes on a new meaning for sure based on what I said before.
</p>

<p>There are medications out there that can help you if you're in the same place as I am. They work
  most of the time, but sometimes they fail and the psychosis gets a little worse. You just have to 
  hang on for the ride and see where it takes you. It's unfortunate that life happens that way, but
  what can you do about it? You just have to keep on hanging in there.
</p>

<p>Hanging in there isn't <em>easy</em> at all. Telling yourself that you want to get better doesn't
  always help matters either. Of course you want to get better. There's nothing wrong with that. Striving
  to feel better can be an uphill battle by itself.
