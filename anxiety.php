<p>Oh anxiety the bane of my existence.
    It's not anything I have control over. Sure there are medications that help
    me get through episodes. But when a Panic Attack hits? Gosh I just don't know
    what to do sometimes.
</p>

<p>What's a panic attack you ask? I'm glad you wonder:</p>

A sudden episode of intense anxiety accompanied by a feeling of impending doom and 
frightening physical symptoms, such as a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea.

<p>There you have it, it's not fun at all. It's something I deal with on a regular basis, but
    that doesn't mean I'm crazy. I mean we know I'm somewhat crazy, but what can you do about it?
    Just take your medications and hope for the best. That's all which can be expected about it.
</p>

<p>I've never felt such a debilitating condition as this. There's nothing that can really
    describe what's going on within your body and mind unless you experience a panic attack
    for yourself. I hope you never experience such an event.

<p>Speaking of anxiety and panic attacks, I do believe I've had one tonight. There's no believe
    about it. I know I've had one tonight. The circumstances don't matter. That's all there is
    to it. I had a panic attack, and I took some medication for it. So that's better and things
    will get better from here on out. At least I hope they do! If not? Uh... well... yeah. We'll
    just have to see where things go.
</p>

<p>Sometimes the worst part about having anxiety is not knowing what the root cause is.
    You get these panic attacks, and these emotions that come along with it all. You sit there
    trying to think up the root cause. What triggered the anxiety this time? Yet all you do is
    come up blank. It sucks. There's no reason to feel this way, yet there you are feeling exactly
    like that. Talk about an annoying part of life.
