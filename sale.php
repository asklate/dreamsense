<p>Every once in a while I get someone interested in buying my domain name. The domain name I've 
    had since 2003.
</p>
<p>They always say the same thing, "I don't have much money" or "I don't have any money" and then 
    ask if I'd be willing to part with the domain. I'm like, wait what? Why would I just part with
    it for little to no money? It doesn't make sense.
</p>

<p>Currently the domain name is not for sale. Inquries will be ignored. Like I won't even e-mail
    you back regarding it.
</p>

<!--
<p>The only way I would consider selling this domain name is for <b>60,000</b> US Dollars. I'm sure no one 
    would even want to have a domain name that bad to pay such a high amount. But ya know, maybe 
    someone would want to. I still wouldn't sell the domain name. She's my pride and joy.
</p>
-->

<p>This domain name is my pride and joy at the moment. I've invested a lot of time into it over the years
    and I don't have a desire to sell it.</p>
