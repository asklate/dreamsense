<h2>2025</h2>

<p>The song plays on. There's nothing different about the tune, it's all the same.
    Always the same. Nothing feels like it's falling into place at the moment. I
    don't know what to do about it.</p>

<h2>2024</h2>

<p>This year started out alright. I'm scared of things. Let's just put that out there.
    What things am I scared of? Oh a lot of things feel overwhelming at the moment. But
    there's not much I can do about it now is there? No, I didn't think so.
</p>

<p>I feel as though closing my eyes makes scenes appear. It prevents me from relaxing
    and being at peace. They tell you to close your eyes and try to calm down by breathing.
    I close my eyes and the nightmares start/continue. Like a constant video running in my mind,
    things I have no control over.</p>

<p>It's not my fault I have these dreams. They just come and go as they please. There's nothing
    wrong with that is there? I mean I wouldn't think there would be anything wrong with it.</p>
