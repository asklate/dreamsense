<p>Love doesn't know color, love doesn't know race, love doesn't respect religion, 
    love doesn't care for any of that. When you love someone, you see past the color
    of their skin, the country they're from, how they identify themselves. You see them
    just as a person, and you love with all your heart.
</p>

<p>Please embrace those in your family who live a different lifestyle than you.
    Do not shun them or push them away. That only does damage to all affected.
