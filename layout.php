<p>You've probably noticed the layout. Some of it makes sense, other parts of it does not.
    You see that's how my mind tends to work most days. Sometimes it just makes sense and
    other times it doesn't. So this is a step into my mind to see how exactly it looks and
    works or doesn't work. Either way it's there.
</p>

<p>When making the website, I thought of many different ideas of how to create the look.
    It was only when I remembered a layout I found on a free template site (OSWD) that I was able
    to recreate what I once had, and this layout was found again.
</p>

<p>I want to incorporate a few easter eggs into this site, but I'm not sure how to do that.
    It's easy to click on a link and follow it. There's not much else that can be done about that.
    I'll have to decide what it is I want to do. I want all of the pages to be able to be crawled
    by any search engine, so that makes it difficult. Oh well I'm sure I'll figure it out.
</p>

<p>The bottom of the website uses columns to display the different data that is there.
    I want to incorporate some kind of popups on the site as well. I'm not sure exactly how
    I will go about doing that. Some kind of javascript magic of course, but not sure
    how to do it all. I'll have to do some research.
