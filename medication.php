    I think the hardest part about being on medications is remembering to take them. Then
    when the bad things start to happen again you remember. Oh yeah, I forgot my meds today.
    So you take them and then you feel better.
</p>

<p>Seriously though, medication can help you feel tons better. Your doctor knows what's good
    for you. But you also have to listen to your body, if the medications aren't working for
    you, then you need to switch them out or have the dosage changed so you can get better.
</p>

<p>Some people believe it's a bad thing to be on medication. That's not the case at all.
    It's not a sign of weakness or anything like that. It's just supplementing something missing
    from your body that helps.
</p>

<p>Don't believe what other people believe on medication. Believe what your doctor tells you.
    Only your doctor can prescribe medication to you. Don't do anything stupid like take meds
    from someone else, their meds are for their minds; just like your meds are for your mind.
